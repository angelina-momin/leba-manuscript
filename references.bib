Such studies, however, have generally been conducted using disparate methodologies which precludes generalization and reproducibility. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to determine the practical applicability of measurement devices for studies investigating non-image-forming effects of luminous radiation, specifically for people with intellectual disabilities or dementia. METHODS In three experiments, ten cognitive impaired people and thirty-nine unaffected subjects participated by wearing one or more portable devices. Six devices were assessed in total. Measurement data was accompanied with user experiences obtained from questionnaires, interviews and observations in order to assess the devices on practical and comfort issues. RESULTS On average, the devices worn by the cognitive impaired subjects were not experienced as annoying or irritating. No significant differences are found between genders and for one of the portable devices significantly less annoyance was reported by the cognitive impaired participants compared to the unaffected group of participants. INNOVATIVE SOLUTION The three phases of the research process in towards measuring personal luminous exposures are: selection of the most suitable portable device, application of the assessment method, and the application of the device in the (pilot) study. CONCLUSIONS However, the findings of this study suggest that inaccuracies potentially caused by practical and comfort issues associated with the portable devices need to be considered.},

	abstract = {Aim: To analyse how age-related losses in crystalline lens transmittance and pupillary area affect circadian photoreception and compare the circadian performance of phakic and pseudophakic individuals of the same age.Methods: The spectral sensitivity of circadian photoreception peaks in the blue part of the spectrum at approximately 460 nm. Photosensitive retinal ganglion cells send unconscious information about environmental illumination to non-visual brain centres including the human body’s master biological clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei. This information permits human physiology to be optimised and aligned with geophysical day–night cycles using neural and hormonal messengers including melatonin. Age-related transmittance spectra of crystalline lenses and photopic pupil diameter are used with the spectral sensitivity of melatonin suppression and the transmittance spectra of intraocular lenses (IOLs) to analyse how ageing and IOL chromophores affect circadian photoreception.Results: Ageing increases crystalline lens light absorption and decreases pupil area resulting in progressive loss of circadian photoreception. A 10-year-old child has circadian photoreception 10-fold greater than a 95-year-old phakic adult. A 45-year-old adult retains only half the circadian photoreception of early youth. Pseudophakia improves circadian photoreception at all ages, particularly with UV-only blocking IOLs which transmit blue wavelengths optimal for non-visual photoreception.Conclusions: Non-visual retinal ganglion photoreceptor responses to bright, properly timed light exposures help assure effective circadian photoentrainment and optimal diurnal physiological processes. Circadian photoreception can persist in visually blind individuals if retinal ganglion cell photoreceptors and their suprachiasmatic connections are intact. Retinal illumination decreases with ageing due to pupillary miosis and reduced crystalline lens light transmission especially of short wavelengths. Inadequate environmental light and/or ganglion photoreception can cause circadian disruption, increasing the risk of insomnia, depression, numerous systemic disorders and possibly early mortality. Artificial lighting is dimmer and less blue-weighted than natural daylight, contributing to age-related losses in unconscious circadian photoreception. Optimal intraocular lens design should consider the spectral requirements of both conscious and unconscious retinal photoreception.},

	abstract = {Sleep is an active physiological state that plays a critical role in our physical and mental health and well-being. It is generated by a complex interplay between two oscillators, namely, the circadian oscillator and the sleep-wake homeostat. Sleep propensity is a function of wakefulness, that is, the longer one is awake the greater the homeostatic sleep pressure. Sleep onset occurs as a wake promoting circadian signal subsides, coinciding with an evening rise in melatonin and drop in core temperature. Light is one of the strongest time signals for the circadian oscillator. Poor sleep is a prevalent complaint today, attributable, in part, to our easy access to artificial light, especially after dusk. This non-visual effect of light is mediated by a multi-component photoreceptive system, consisting of rods, cones and melanopsin-expressing intrinsically-photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGC). Perhaps, with this available biological knowledge we can engineer artificial light to minimize its disruptive effect on sleep. We will highlight this by discussing circadian photoreception and its effect on sleep, in the blind population.},

	abstract = {Endocrine systems function as key mediators of adaptive responses to the external environment. As a reliable predictor of many salient variations in the external world, the light environment thus constitutes an influential source of control over neuroendocrine function. Accordingly, the vast majority of endocrine systems display 24hr variations in activity that are aligned to daily changes in external illumination. While the neural mechanisms responsible for driving these rhythms are still incompletely understood, circadian and light-dependent signals relayed via the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus (SCN) play a key role. Retinal projections to the SCN provide information from rods, cones and melanopsin, which, together, encode variations in the amount and spectral content of ambient light over the solar day. This sensory input, in turn, drives acute modulations in SCN cellular activity and aligns daily rhythms in the electrophysiological output of individual clock neurons. Neural outputs from the SCN can therefore convey both rapid and longer-term information about the light environment to other hypothalamic nuclei responsible for neuroendocrine control. In this review we summarises current understanding of the specific neural pathways by which the light environment influences key neuroendocrine axes, with a particular focus on the retinal and SCN-dependent circuits involved and their known sensory properties.},

Our circadian pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) in the hypothalamus, is entrained to the 24-hour solar day via a pathway from the retina and synchronises our internal biological rhythms. Rhythmic variations in ambient illumination impact behaviours such as rest during sleep and activity during wakefulness as well as their underlying biological processes. Rather recently, the availability of artificial light has substantially changed the light environment, especially during evening and night hours. This may increase the risk of developing circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders (CRSWD), which are often caused by a misalignment of endogenous circadian rhythms and external light-dark cycles. While the exact relationship between the availability of artificial light and CRSWD remains to be established, nocturnal light has been shown to alter circadian rhythms and sleep in humans. On the other hand, light can also be used as an effective and noninvasive therapeutic option with little to no side effects, to improve sleep,mood and general well-being.

With the invention of electrical lights about a century ago, the temporal organization of the environment has been drastically altered for many species, including humans. In addition to the incidental exposure to light at night through light pollution, humans also engage in increasing amounts of shift-work, resulting in repeated and often long-term circadian disruption. The increasing prevalence of exposure to light at night has significant social, ecological, behavioral, and health consequences that are only now becoming apparent.

It is concluded that human health is undoubtedly influenced by lighting, but there are four conditions that should be attached to such a simple assertion. First, the impact of lighting on human health can be either positive or negative. Second, human health is affected by many factors other than lighting. Third, the severity of the effects of light exposure can vary widely from the short-lived and trivial to the long-term and fatal. Fourth, the same lighting conditions can have very different health impacts for different individuals depending on their age and medical status. Taken together, these conditions imply that care is required when judging the veracity and relevance of broad assertions about the benefits of lighting for human health.},

Such responses employ dedicated retinal circuits encompassing melanopsin photoreceptors. Here, we aimed to determine whether this arrangement can be exploited to modulate the impact of VDUs on melatonin onset and alertness without altering visual appearance.We generated a five-primary VDU capable of presenting metameric movies (matched for color and luminance) but varying in melanopic-irradiance. Healthy human participants (n = 11) were exposed to the VDU from 18:00 to 23:00 hours at high- or low-melanopic setting in a randomized cross-over design and measured salivary melatonin and self-reported sleepiness at 30-minute intervals.Our VDU presented a 3× adjustment in melanopic-irradiance for images matched photometrically for color and luminance. Participants reported no significant difference in visual appearance (color and glare) between conditions. During the time in which the VDU was viewed, self-reported sleepiness and salivary melatonin levels increased significantly, as would be expected in this phase of the diurnal cycle. The magnitude of the increase in both parameters was significantly enhanced when melanopic-irradiance was reduced.Our data demonstrate that melatonin onset and self-reported sleepiness can be modulated independent of photometric parameters (color and luminance) under a commonly encountered light exposure scenario (evening use of a VDU). They provide the first demonstration that the impact of light on alertness and melatonin production can be controlled independently of visual experience, and establish a VDU capable of achieving this objective.},

 abstract = {Temporal organization of physiology is critical for human health. In the past, humans experienced predictable periods of daily light and dark driven by the solar day, which allowed for entrainment of intrinsic circadian rhythms to the environmental light-dark cycles. Since the adoption of electric light, however, pervasive exposure to nighttime lighting has blurred the boundaries of day and night, making it more difficult to synchronize biological processes. Many systems are under circadian control, including sleep-wake behavior, hormone secretion, cellular function and gene expression. Circadian disruption by nighttime light perturbs those processes and is associated with increasing incidence of certain cancers, metabolic dysfunction and mood disorders. This review focuses on the role of artificial light at night in mood regulation, including mechanisms through which aberrant light exposure affects the brain. Converging evidence suggests that circadian disruption alters the function of brain regions involved in emotion and mood regulation. This occurs through direct neural input from the clock or indirect effects, including altered neuroplasticity, neurotransmission and clock gene expression. Recently, the aberrant light exposure has been recognized for its health effects. This review summarizes the evidence linking aberrant light exposure to mood.},

 abstract = {Because human activities impact the timing, location, and degree of pollutant exposure, they play a key role in explaining exposure variation. This fact has motivated the collection of activity pattern data for their specific use in exposure assessments. The largest of these recent efforts is the National Human Activity Pattern Survey (NHAPS), a 2-year probability-based telephone survey (n=9386) of exposure-related human activities in the United States (U.S.) sponsored by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The primary purpose of NHAPS was to provide comprehensive and current exposure information over broad geographical and temporal scales, particularly for use in probabilistic population exposure models. NHAPS was conducted on a virtually daily basis from late September 1992 through September 1994 by the University of Maryland's Survey Research Center using a computer-assisted telephone interview instrument (CATI) to collect 24-h retrospective diaries and answers to a number of personal and exposure-related questions from each respondent. The resulting diary records contain beginning and ending times for each distinct combination of location and activity occurring on the diary day (i.e., each microenvironment). Between 340 and 1713 respondents of all ages were interviewed in each of the 10 EPA regions across the 48 contiguous states. Interviews were completed in 63{\%} of the households contacted. NHAPS respondents reported spending an average of 87{\%} of their time in enclosed buildings and about 6{\%} of their time in enclosed vehicles. These proportions are fairly constant across the various regions of the U.S. and Canada and for the California population between the late 1980s, when the California Air Resources Board (CARB) sponsored a state-wide activity pattern study, and the mid-1990s, when NHAPS was conducted. However, the number of people exposed to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) in California seems to have decreased over the same time period, where exposure is determined by the reported time spent with a smoker. In both California and the entire nation, the most time spent exposed to ETS was reported to take place in residential locations.},

@article{Lunn.2017,
 abstract = {The invention of electric light has facilitated a society in which people work, sleep, eat, and play at all hours of the 24-hour day. Although electric light clearly has benefited humankind, exposures to electric light, especially light at night (LAN), may disrupt sleep and biological processes controlled by endogenous circadian clocks, potentially resulting in adverse health outcomes. Many of the studies evaluating adverse health effects have been conducted among night- and rotating-shift workers, because this scenario gives rise to significant exposure to LAN. Because of the complexity of this topic, the National Toxicology Program convened an expert panel at a public workshop entitled {\textquotedbl}Shift Work at Night, Artificial Light at Night, and Circadian Disruption{\textquotedbl} to obtain input on conducting literature-based health hazard assessments and to identify data gaps and research needs. The Panel suggested describing light both as a direct effector of endogenous circadian clocks and rhythms and as an enabler of additional activities or behaviors that may lead to circadian disruption, such as night-shift work and atypical and inconsistent sleep-wake patterns that can lead to social jet lag. Future studies should more comprehensively characterize and measure the relevant light-related exposures and link these exposures to both time-independent biomarkers of circadian disruption and biomarkers of adverse health outcomes. This information should lead to improvements in human epidemiological and animal or in vitro models, more rigorous health hazard assessments, and intervention strategies to minimize the occurrence of adverse health outcomes due to these exposures.},

@article{Chellappa.2019,
 abstract = {The circadian system, that is ubiquitous across species, generates $\sim$24~h rhythms in virtually all biological processes, and allows them to anticipate and adapt to the 24~h day/night cycle, thus ensuring optimal physiological function. Epidemiological studies show time-of-day variations in adverse cardiovascular (CV) events, and controlled laboratory studies demonstrate a circadian influence on key markers of CV function and risk. Furthermore, circadian misalignment, that is typically experienced by shift workers as well as by individuals who experience late eating, (social) jet lag, or circadian rhythm sleep-wake disturbances, increases CV risk factors. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms by which the circadian system regulates CV function, and which of these are affected by circadian disruption, may help to develop intervention strategies to mitigate CV risk.},
