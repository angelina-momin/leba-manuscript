It includes the key introductory topics and extends to recent research developments, such as multidimensional item response theory models. The focus is on the practical implementation of the methods, with lots of real data examples and R code integrated throughout. The book will be supplemented by an R package with all code and data available for replication. The book could be used as a supplementary text for the computing component of a course on measurement in either department{"}--},
