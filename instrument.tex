\textbf{Disclaimer}: This is a non-public version of LEBA (dated \today)
and still a work in progress. Please do not distribute!

LEBA captures light exposure-related behaviours on a 5 point Likert type
scale ranging from 1 to 5 (Never/Does not apply/I don't know = 1; Rarely
= 2; Sometimes = 3; Often = 4; Always = 5). The score of each factor is
calculated by the summation of scores of items belonging to the
corresponding factor.
