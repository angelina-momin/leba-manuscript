(ref:foo) Factor Identification Methods (A) Parallel analysis drew 500 sets of random data set (n=428 each) and adjusted the mean eigenvalues for sample bias. In x-axis we plotted the number of possible factors and in y-axis we plotted the mean adjusted eigenvalues. The First inflection point of the plot indicated the optimal number of factors were six. (B) In the scree plot possible number of factors are plotted against obtained eigenvalues. Scree plot suggested six factors. (C) Hull method we plotted the number of possible factors in the x-axis and the CAF index(CAF: Common Part Accounted for-an indicator of model fit) in the y-axis. Hull method indicated 5 factors were required to balance the model fit and number of parameters.
